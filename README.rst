About
=====

GeanyPlot is a Geany plugin for data visualization written in Python. The
plugin needs codebrainz' GeanyPy (see https://github.com/codebrainz/geanypy).

The plugin is supposed to be used for quick data inspection without the need
to run a Python session just for the purpose of visualization. The plugin
uses Matplotlib.

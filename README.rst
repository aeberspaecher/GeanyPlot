About
=====

GeanyPlot is a Geany plugin for data visualization written in Python. The
plugin needs codebrainz' GeanyPy (see https://github.com/codebrainz/geanypy).

The plugin is supposed to be used for quick data inspection without the need
to run a Python session just for the purpose of visualization. The plugin
uses Matplotlib.

Usage
=====

Open and select the file that contains the data to visualize. Select Tools
--> Plot data and choose whether you want a line or scatter plot. Then,
select the column that contains the x-values for the plot. Finally, one can
choose or or more columns for y data.
